## About this project

This project was developed during the Multistack free workshop from [TreinaWeb](https://www.treinaweb.com.br/), a very good development online school.

The **e-diaristas** project was divided in two parts: The frontend (this one), and the backend that can be found in [ediaristas-backend repository](https://github.com/pmmdesenvolvedor/ediaristas-backend).

Since the local backend project was properly initiated, change the URL at `src/data/services/Api.service.ts` and the frontend and backend will be integrated.

## Project purpose

ATENTION: This is not a commercial project!

This project was created during a workshop to practice the exercises and learn about web application development using React and Next.js, and integration between frontend and backend.

Feel free to use this to modify as you study it.
